        <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            BillSpilt is a free bill splitter built for roommates and shared
            households. It exists to solve one specific, universally annoying
            problem: when several people share a home, the money gets tangled
            fast. Rent, internet, the electric bill, a grocery run, the shared
            streaming subscription — someone always covers something, and
            keeping track of who owes whom turns into group-chat math nobody
            enjoys.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built BillSpilt to make that math disappear. You log a shared
            expense in a few seconds — who paid, how much, how it&apos;s split,
            and who&apos;s included. From there the app keeps a running balance
            for every person in the household, so anyone can open it and see, at
            a glance, whether they&apos;re owed money or owe it. When it&apos;s
            time to square up, BillSpilt nets all the debts and works out the
            fewest possible payments that clear them — four roommates might
            settle everything with just two transfers instead of a dozen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The whole thing runs in your browser and installs to your home
            screen like a native app, so there&apos;s nothing to download from
            an app store. It even works offline: add an expense with no signal
            and it syncs automatically when you reconnect.
          </p>

          BillSpilt is made for anyone sharing recurring costs: roommates in a
          house or apartment, couples splitting a household, friends on a group
          trip, or families dividing shared bills. If more than one person pays
          into the same pot, BillSpilt keeps it straight — for up to twelve
          people in a single household.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">How BillSpilt stays free</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          Plenty of bill-splitting apps lock the useful parts — recurring bills,
          reminders, receipt photos, multiple admins — behind a subscription. We
          took the opposite approach: everything is free, and the site is
          supported by advertising on our public pages. That model is what lets
          us keep the app itself clean and every feature unlocked for the
          roommates who rely on it. We never hold or process your money, and we
          don&apos;t sell your data — see our{" "}
