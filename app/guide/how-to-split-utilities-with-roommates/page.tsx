    name: "Spread the accounts across roommates",
    text: "Don't put every bill in one person's name — split who holds which account so no single roommate is fronting all the cash and chasing everyone else. One takes electric, another internet, another water, and so on. It also spreads the credit-history benefit.",

  {
    name: "Default to an even split for shared utilities",
    text: "For most houses, splitting each utility evenly is fair and simple — everyone benefits from heat, water, and Wi-Fi roughly equally. Use exact or percentage splits only when usage is genuinely lopsided (a home office running AC all day, or a roommate who's away half the month).",
  },
  {
    name: "Handle the seasonal swings",
    text: "Electric and gas spike in summer and winter. Rather than re-arguing each month, agree up front to just split the actual bill whatever it is — the person whose name is on it logs the real amount, and everyone pays their share of that month's total.",
  },
  {
    name: "Reconcile everything in one place",
    text: "Because different bills sit with different people, you need one running tally of who's paid what so it all nets out. That's exactly what a roommate bill splitter is for — each utility becomes a logged (often recurring) expense, and the app keeps everyone's balance square.",

const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "How should roommates split utility bills?",
    a: "For most households, split each shared utility evenly — everyone benefits from heating, water, and Wi-Fi at roughly the same level, and an even split is simple and hard to argue with. Reserve exact or percentage splits for cases where usage is genuinely lopsided, such as a roommate who works from home and runs the AC all day, or someone who travels for half the month.",
  },
  {
    q: "Whose name should the utilities be in?",
    a: "Spread them out. Putting every account in one person's name means that roommate fronts all the money and has to chase everyone for reimbursement. Give each roommate one or two accounts — one holds electric, another internet, another water. It balances the cash flow and shares the credit-building benefit of paying bills on time.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you split a utility bill that changes every month?",
    a: "Agree once to split whatever the actual bill is, rather than a fixed estimate. The roommate whose name is on the account logs the real amount each month and everyone pays their share of that total. Logging it as a recurring expense means the split is applied automatically even as the number moves.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should internet be split evenly?",
    a: "Almost always yes. Internet is a fixed monthly cost that everyone in the house uses, so an even split is the fairest and simplest option. The only common exception is a roommate who is rarely home — some households give them a reduced share by agreement, but that's a choice, not a rule.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle a roommate who uses way more than everyone else?",
    a: "First, decide whether the difference is big enough to matter — small variations aren't worth the friction. If one person genuinely drives a bill (a gaming rig, a space heater, a home business), switch that specific utility to a percentage split that reflects usage, and leave the rest even. Naming it openly and adjusting one bill is far better than silent resentment.",

        How to split utility bills with roommates
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
        Utilities are the messiest shared cost: several bills, different due
        dates, different names on the account, and amounts that change every
        month. Rent is one predictable number; utilities are five moving ones.
        Here&apos;s a simple system that keeps it fair without a monthly
        negotiation.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">A worked example</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
          Three roommates hold different accounts in one month:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-4 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li>• Sam&apos;s name is on <strong>electric: $135</strong> (even = $45 each)</li>
          <li>• Priya&apos;s name is on <strong>internet: $60</strong> (even = $20 each)</li>
          <li>• Leo&apos;s name is on <strong>water + trash: $75</strong> (even = $25 each)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          Total utilities are $270, so each person&apos;s fair share is $90. Sam
          paid $135, Priya paid $60, Leo paid $75. Netting it out: Priya owes $30
          and Leo owes $15, and both pay Sam. Two small transfers square the
          whole month — no one had to front everything, and nobody&apos;s doing
          arithmetic at the kitchen table.
