  {
    name: "Ask early, ask small, ask often",
    text: "Don't let a $15 here and $20 there pile into an awkward $200 ask three months later. Settling up regularly keeps each amount small and normal, so nobody feels cornered and the friendship never carries a big invisible IOU.",

    name: "Be direct and kind — and pick the right channel",
    text: "A friendly, specific text beats a passive-aggressive sticky note or a tense in-person ambush. Something like: 'Hey! Settled up the utilities — you're at $32 for this month, no rush. Venmo or Cash App whenever.' Warm, exact, and easy to act on.",
  },
  {
    name: "Make paying frictionless",
    text: "People pay back faster when it takes one tap. Share your Venmo or Cash App handle and ideally a pre-filled amount, so 'I'll get you later' doesn't become next month. Remove every reason to put it off.",

const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "How do I ask my roommate for money without it being awkward?",
    a: "Keep it specific, small, and easy to act on. Reference the exact expenses and the exact amount ('$42 for electric and your half of groceries'), ask early before it grows, and give them a one-tap way to pay like a Venmo or Cash App link. A friendly, factual text lands far better than a passive-aggressive note or an in-person ambush.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do I do if my roommate keeps 'forgetting' to pay me back?",
    a: "Remove the ambiguity first — a shared running balance everyone can see makes 'I forgot' much harder. Send a specific reminder referencing the amount and what it's for. If it's a pattern, stop fronting their share: put big bills in their name, or ask for their portion up front before you pay for shared purchases.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I charge a roommate interest or a late fee for money owed?",
    a: "For everyday shared bills between friends, no — it usually causes more friction than it's worth and can damage the relationship. The better lever is frequency: settle up monthly so no single amount ever gets large enough to need a late fee. Reserve formal terms for genuinely large, one-off shared purchases, and agree them in writing beforehand.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should I ask roommates to settle up?",
    a: "Monthly is ideal. It keeps each person's balance small and predictable, lines up with rent and utility cycles, and normalizes the ask so it never feels like a confrontation. Weekly can feel like nagging; letting it run for months lets balances grow into tense, hard-to-pay sums.",

        Chasing a roommate for money is the fastest way to make home feel
        uncomfortable. The trick is to make the ask small, specific, and
        friction-free — or to avoid having to ask at all.
